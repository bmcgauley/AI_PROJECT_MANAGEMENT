To build a multi-AI agent system that supports the given requirements, we can follow these steps:

Define Agent Interfaces: Organize all the different AI agents into categories based on their primary function and use case. Hereâ€™s how you could define them using Python classes with methods corresponding to their functions.

Agent Class Structure:

Chat Coordinator: Manages user interaction, orchestrates communication, and handles different agents.
Project Manager: Manages project planning, task management, Jira integration.
Research Specialist: Invokes external information sources through APIs.
Business Analyst: Analyzes requirements to create detailed project specifications.
Code Developer: Writes code based on specifications.
Code Reviewer: Evaluates existing code for quality.
Report Drafter: Generates project documents and reports.
Report Reviewer: Evaluates the quality of outputted reports.
Integration: Coordinates communication with other agents or services.
Report Publisher: Formats and finalizes reports for distribution.
Agent Implementation:

Define abstract classes (e.g., BaseAgent) to ensure that implementing classes have a consistent interface.
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseAgent(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def run(self):
        pass

Create actual classes for each agent type.
class ProjectManager(BaseAgent):
    # Implement project management functionality
    pass

class Research Specialist(BaseAgent):
    # Implements information gathering through API calls
    pass

# Other agents...

Chat Coordinator Implementation:

Manage interactions between different agent instances.
class ChatCoordinator:
    def __init__(self, agents: list[BaseAgent]):
        self.agents = agents

    def handle_user_request(self, request):
        for agent in self.agents:
            response = agent.run()
            if response:
                return response

    # Other chat coordinator functionality...

MCP Server Implementation:

Use mcp (Message Control Protocol) tools and services to facilitate integrations between agents.
from mcp import AgentMCP

# Create an instance of the ChatCoordinator with appropriate agent instances
chat_coordinator = ChatCoordinator([
    ProjectManager(),
    Research Specialist()
])

# Example of sending a request to the chat coordinator through MCP
result = chat_coordinator.handle_user_request("I need help planning this project.")
print(result)

Database Setup:

To track project activities, use a SQL database with tables for projects, tasks, and reports.
# Example of adding data to the database using SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, text
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class Project(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'projects'
    id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String())

# Create the database engine and sessionmaker
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///project.db')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Example of Adding a project to the database
new_project = Project(title="New Project")
session.add(new_project)
session.commit()

Unit Testing and Continuous Integration:

Write unit tests for all agents and their interactions.
Use continuous integration services (like GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to automate testing and deployment.
Documentation Generation:

Use tools like Sphinx or Jupyter Notebook to generate documentation for the project.
Integrate generated documentation into the chat coordinator's output.
9.Deployment and Scaling:

Implement a scalable architecture that can handle multiple users, projects, and agents.
Scale using cloud services (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) to dynamically scale based on load.
Example of Implementing a Chat Coordinator with Database Interaction
import sqlite3

# Define the ProjectManager class
class ProjectManager(BaseAgent):
    def run(self):
        # Connect to the database
        conn = sqlite3.connect('project.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        # Fetch project information from the database
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM projects WHERE id = ?", (1,))
        project_info = cursor.fetchone()

        if project_info:
            # Return a response or perform other operations based on the project
            return "Project status is active."
        else:
            return "Project not found."

        # Close the database connection
        conn.close()

By following these steps, you can build a multi-AI agent system that supports various functions and integrates seamlessly with different components of an enterprise-level software development environment.

Project Mnager:
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Setup the MCP Server
First, ensure your MCP server is up and running. You can get started by following the instructions in the Atlassian Documentation.

2. Install MuleSoft Connect Proxy
Next, install MuleSoft Connect proxy on your machine. You can download the connector from the MuleSoft Marketplace.

3. Create a New Project
Create a new project in MCP:

Navigate to the Atlassian MCP console.
Select "Project" and proceed to create a new project.
Add components and channels:

In your project, add a new channel for HTTP requests.
Add a new component for making HTTP calls to Jira (e.g., HTTP Request).
Configure the channel to make HTTP GET or POST requests to the Jira REST API endpoints for managing tasks and projects.
Configure the channels:

For example, if you need to retrieve information from a task in Jira, configure the channel with a request that makes an HTTP GET request to the Jira /rest/api/2/task/<task-id> endpoint.
Similarly, for creating or updating tasks, configure separate channels with requests that make POST or PUT requests respectively.
4. Create API Endpoints
For each task and project management operation you want to expose via your tool, create a corresponding API endpoint using the MCP proxy:

Retrieve information:

For example, to retrieve all tasks from Jira, add a channel that makes an HTTP GET request to /rest/api/2/task.
Configure this channel with a response format that can be easily parsed by your tool.
Create or update task:

For example, to create a new task in Jira, add a channel that makes an HTTP POST request to /rest/api/2/task.
Ensure the JSON payload includes all necessary fields for creating a Jira issue.
5. Test Your Tool
Publish your tools:

After configuring and testing your channels and API endpoints, publish them in the MCP project.
Connect with your client or developer:

Send requests to your API endpoints using any tool you prefer (e.g., Postman).
Verify that you receive the expected data from Jira by comparing it with the output of your tool.
6. Documentation and User Guide
Create a user guide:

Write clear instructions on how to use your atlassian Project Manager tool.
Include examples and screenshots for easy understanding.
Publish documentation:

Publish the user guide within the MCP project, making it accessible to all users via the project's documentation section.
7. Continuous Improvement
Monitor performance:

Continuously monitor performance to ensure that your tool can handle real-world load and respond swiftly.
Updates and patches:

Keep up with Atlassian updates to ensure that your tool is compatible and features latest Jira API changes.
This example provides a basic framework for an atlassian Project Manager tool using the MCP proxy server. You can further expand on this by adding authentication, error handling, and more advanced features based on your specific requirements.

To integrate with Atlassian Jira from inside a multi-agent system like yours, where projects are managed, tasks are planned and organized, and code development and code reviews are involved, it's necessary to use an appropriate Atlassian API. A commonly used API for this purpose is the REST API provided by Atlassian Jira.

Below you can see how you can update your project manager agent to leverage the Atlassian Jira API:

from mcp import AgentMCP

# Create an instance of the ProjectManager with appropriate agent instances
chat_coordinator = ChatCoordinator([
    ProjectManager(),
    Research Specialist()
])

class ProjectManager(Agent):
    def handle_user_request(self, user_query):
        response = {"name": "Project Manager", "arguments": None}
        # Example: Querying Jira for projects and tasks.
        jira = self. invokeJiraAPI('query', 'SELECT key FROM project ORDER BY name')
        response["response"] = jira
        return response

    def invokeJiraAPI(self, method, params):
        """ Invokes the Atlassian Jira RESTful API.

        Args:
            method: HTTP method to use ('GET', 'POST', etc.).
            params (str): Comma separated key/values param string or a dict for POST calls.
        """
        url = "https://your-jira-server/rest/api/latest/{0}".format(method)
        headers = {'Accept': 'application/json'}
        response = self.http_request method=url, body=payload.json(), headers=headers)
        return response.content.decode('utf-8')

    # Add more methods if needed for other Jira operations.

In the above code:

We create an instance of MCPAgentCordinator with instances of the ProjectManager agent.
The handle_user_request method is updated to call a new function invokeJiraAPI which makes a GET request to the Jira API and returns the response.
This setup allows you to efficiently handle tasks such as project planning, task management, as well as integrating with other Atlassian services for tasks like Jira, allowing a streamlined workflow within your multi-agent system.

To integrate with Jira and Confluence, you will need to set up both the Jira and Confluence tools in the MCP server. Additionally, you may need to configure the OAuth 2.0 credentials and environment variables as demonstrated in the Quick Start Guide.

To refine the Python code for your web scraping chatbot using Brave as a web search engine, we need to follow these steps:

Define the Agent Class: Extend from Agent and specify the model context.
Implement Web Scraping Tool:
Set up API Key Handling (optional)
Execute Queries with Brave Search Engine.
Step 1: Define the Agent Class
Here's how you can define an agent that uses Brave:

from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic_agents.agent import Agent, tool
from pydantic_tools import WebSearch

class WebScraperAgent(Agent):
    model_context: BaseModel  # The context of the model; should include API keys for Brave search

    class Config:
        enable_mcp = True  # Enable message chain processing

    brave_search: Optional[WebSearch] = None

    def initialize_brave_api(self):
        self.brave_search = WebSearch(api_keys=[self.model_context["brave_api_key"]])

Step 2: Implement the Web Scraping Tool
We can use BeautifulSoup with Python to fetchç½‘é¡µ content:

Add External import for BeautifulSoup if it's not already installed:

pip install beautifulsoup4

Implement WebScraperTool function:

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
 from typing import List, Dict

 @tool
 def web_search(query: str) -> list[str]:
     if not self.brave_search:
         self.initialize_brave_api()

     # Fetch the search results using Brave's web search engine
     results = self.brave_search.search(query)
     html_content = []

     for page in results:
         soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
         article_body = soup.find('body').get_text()

         # Append the extracted text to the list
         html_content.append(article_body)

     return html_content

Step 3: Set up API Key Handling (Optional)
If you need to specify Brave's API keys securely, you can do so by adding them to a .env file or using environment variables. Hereâ€™s how you can read these from an .env file:

Create .env file:

BRAVE_API_KEY=value_for_brave_search_engine

Read API Key from model_context in the agent:

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
import os

class WebScraperAgent(Agent):
    model_context: BaseModel = Field(default_factory=lambda: BaseModel(api_keys=[]))

    def initialize_brave_api(self):
        self.brave_search = WebSearch(api_keys=os.getenv("BRAVE_API_KEY")))

Step 4: Execute Queries with Brave Search Engine
Finally, you can execute queries using the web_search tool:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    # Example model context with API key
    context = BaseModel(api_keys=["value_for_brave_search_engine"])

    agent = WebScraperAgent(model_context=context)

    query = "AI"
    results = agent.web_search(query)

    for page in results[:5]:  # Display top few results
        print(page)

Summary
This refined version of the web scraping chatbot using Brave is now ready to fetch search results from Brave, execute queries securely, and fetch content from web pages. You can further extend this agent with additional tools or specific functionality based on your requirements.
