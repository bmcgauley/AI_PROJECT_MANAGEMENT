Overview
You can create a robust AI agent system in Python that meets your requirements for project management and coding assistance. By leveraging CrewAI for multi-agent coordination and MCP for integrating with Jira, you can build a system that runs locally on Windows and is accessible remotely. Cursor, an AI-powered code editor, will enhance your coding workflow, while downloadable LLMs ensure local execution. The system will support at least 6 agents, with one using a loop, and handle tasks like Jira management, multi-language coding, code review, and report generation.

Feasibility of Jira Integration
Research suggests that integrating with Jira is straightforward using existing MCP servers, such as the Jira-Context-MCP. These servers allow Cursor to interact with Jira for tasks like creating issues, updating sprints, and generating reports. You may need to customize these servers to fully align with your PMBOK requirements, but building a custom solution from scratch is likely unnecessary.

Starting Point
To begin, set up a Python environment with CrewAI, the MCP Python SDK, and the Jira Python SDK. Use Cursor to write and manage your code. Create MCP servers for Jira and other tools, and define agents using CrewAI to handle project management, coding, and reporting tasks. The provided repository template below will help you start quickly.

Next Steps
Install Cursor and required Python packages.
Configure MCP servers for Jira integration.
Implement the agent system using the provided template.
Test locally, then plan for self-hosting using containerization (e.g., Docker).

Introduction
Building an AI agent system in Python that integrates project management with coding capabilities is a complex but achievable task. Your requirements include developing at least 6 agents on Windows, using Cursor for coding, running downloadable LLMs locally, and enabling remote access through self-hosting. The system must integrate with Jira for project management, support multiple coding languages (Python, React, NextJS, HTML, CSS), ensure type safety with Vercel, and autonomously handle code review, testing, and PMBOK-compliant reporting. Below, I outline the feasibility, provide a detailed list of agents, suggest improvements, present a flowchart for agent interactions, and offer an initial Python repository setup for Cursor.

Feasibility Analysis
From a business project management perspective, the system must align with PMBOK standards, automating tasks like creating sprints, epics, and reports (e.g., RAID logs, SOAP, project charters). The Jira-Context-MCP and other MCP servers indicate that Jira integration is feasible without building a custom solution from scratch. Customization may be needed to support advanced PMBOK reporting, but the Jira Python SDK (Jira Python SDK) provides robust functionality for task management.

From an Information Systems perspective, CrewAI (CrewAI Documentation) is a suitable framework for orchestrating multiple AI agents. The MCP Python SDK (MCP Python SDK) enables integration with external tools like Jira, while Cursor’s agent mode (Cursor Features) supports coding tasks. Downloadable LLMs (e.g., via Ollama or LM Studio) ensure local execution, and containerization (e.g., Docker) supports future self-hosting. The system’s autonomy relies on well-defined agent roles and robust data storage, which can be achieved using SQLite for local persistence.

Comprehensive List of Agents
To meet your requirement of at least 6 agents, with one using a loop, I propose the following 8 agents, each with specific roles and tools:

Agent	Role	Tools
Questioner Agent	Gathers project requirements and clarifies ambiguities via user interaction	NLP (e.g., LangChain, OpenAI)
Coordinator Agent	Manages workflow, assigns tasks, and monitors progress (uses a loop)	Task orchestration, MCP client for task status
Project Management Agent	Interacts with Jira for task creation, updates, sprints, and reports	Jira MCP server, Jira Python SDK
Coding Agent	Writes code in Python, React, NextJS, HTML, CSS with Vercel compatibility	LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic), Vercel APIs, TypeScript tools
Review Agent	Reviews and corrects code for errors and quality	LLMs for code review, static analysis tools (e.g., ESLint, Pylint)
Tester Agent	Runs automated tests on generated code	Testing frameworks (e.g., Pytest, Jest)
Deployer Agent	Deploys code to production environments (e.g., Vercel)	Vercel APIs, deployment scripts
Report Generator Agent	Generates PMBOK-compliant reports (e.g., RAID log, SOAP, project charter)	Data extraction from Jira, report generation libraries (e.g., ReportLab)
The Coordinator Agent uses a loop to continuously monitor task status in Jira and reassign tasks as needed, fulfilling your loop requirement.

Agent Interaction Flowchart
The agents interact in a structured workflow, which can be visualized using a tool like draw.io. Below is a textual representation of the flowchart:

[Coordinator Agent] -> [Coding Agent] -> [Code]
[Coding Agent] -> [Review Agent] -> [Feedback]
[Review Agent] -> [Coding Agent] (if revisions needed)
[Coding Agent] -> [Tester Agent] -> [Test Results]
[Tester Agent] -> [Coordinator Agent]

Nodes: Represent agents (e.g., Questioner Agent, Coordinator Agent).
Arrows: Indicate the flow of tasks or information.
Loop: The Coordinator Agent’s loop checks Jira task status and reassigns tasks.
To visualize, copy this structure into draw.io, create nodes for each agent, and connect them with arrows as described.

Improvements
To enhance the system, consider the following:

Specialized Coding Agents: Create separate agents for Python, React, and NextJS to improve expertise and efficiency.
Learning Mechanism: Implement feedback loops where agents learn from past errors or user feedback to improve performance.
Version Control Integration: Add an agent for Git operations to manage code versions and collaborate with repositories.
CI/CD Integration: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.
Advanced Reporting: Use visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly for interactive project reports.
Robust Error Handling: Ensure agents handle errors gracefully, with logging and recovery mechanisms.
Security Measures: Implement authentication and authorization for Jira and deployment tasks to prevent unauthorized access.
