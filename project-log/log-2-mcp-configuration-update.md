# AI Project Management System - Status Update Log 2
*Date: April 30, 2025*

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive update on the AI Project Management System, detailing the recent changes to the system architecture, Docker methodology, MCP integration, and agent swarm implementation. This log serves as documentation for the current state of the project and outlines the pending tasks and ongoing debugging efforts.

## Development Environment Setup

### Codespaces Architecture

The development environment has been reconfigured using VS Code with Codespaces, providing a container-based development experience that enables:

- **Consistent Environment**: Access from any computer to the same development container
- **Submodule Repository Structure**: Main DevWorkspace repo contains the AI Project Management project as a submodule
- **Backup Integration**: Automated scripts sync all work to a local NAS for reliable backups
- **Multi-Window Workflow**: Ability to open the AI Project Management project in a dedicated window for focused development

This setup replaces the previous more rigid Docker configuration, allowing for greater flexibility while maintaining consistency across different development environments.

### Project Structure

The AI Project Management system is organized as follows:

- `/workspaces/DevWorkspace/projects/AI_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/` - Main project directory
  - `src/` - Core agent implementation code
  - `documents/` - Documentation files including PDFs
  - `project-log/` - Ongoing development logs
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration configuration
  - `mcp.json` - Model Context Protocol configuration for agent interaction

## MCP Integration

### MCP Server Architecture

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation has been completely redesigned to better support the agent swarm approach. The system now uses a series of specialized MCP servers, each providing specific capabilities to the agent swarm:

1. **Ollama MCP Server**: Custom Python implementation for communicating with Ollama's API
2. **Filesystem MCP**: Provides file system access capabilities
3. **GitHub MCP**: Enables interaction with GitHub repositories
4. **Brave Search MCP**: Provides web search capabilities
5. **Memory MCP**: Implements a knowledge graph for persistent agent memory
6. **Sequential Thinking MCP**: Enables structured problem-solving for complex tasks
7. **Atlassian MCP**: Provides integration with Jira for project management tasks
8. **Everything MCP**: Collection of utility tools for the agent system

Each MCP server follows the standard MCP protocol, communicating via JSON-RPC over standard input/output or TCP connections.

### MCP Server Management

MCP servers are now managed through dedicated startup and shutdown scripts:

- `start-mcp-servers.py`: Launches all required MCP servers with proper environment configuration
- `stop-mcp-servers.sh`: Safely terminates running MCP servers

These scripts handle process tracking, log management, and environment variable setup, making the development workflow much smoother than the previous approach.

## Docker Methodology Changes

### Previous Approach

The previous Docker setup used:
- A monolithic container architecture
- Hard-coded paths and configurations
- Limited portability across different environments
- Tightly coupled agent implementation

### Current Approach

The new Docker methodology provides:

1. **Modular MCP Servers**: Each capability is isolated in its own container
2. **Networking**: Dedicated `mcp-network-aipm` for inter-service communication
3. **Volume Mounting**: Proper volume management through:
   - `mcp-filesystem-data-aipm` for file system data persistence
   - Host volume mappings for project-specific data
4. **Environment Variables**: Centralized management of API keys and configuration
5. **Logging Infrastructure**: Standardized logging to `/workspaces/DevWorkspace/logs/` directory

This redesign allows individual components to be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system.

## Ollama Integration

The AI Project Management system interfaces with Ollama as the foundation for all agent operations, using the tinyllama model for natural language understanding and generation.

### Current Implementation

- **Custom MCP Server**: Python-based Ollama MCP server at `/workspaces/DevWorkspace/MCPServers/Ollama-mcp/`
- **Host Connection**: Configured to connect to Ollama running on the host machine via `host.docker.internal:11434`
- **Default Model**: Currently set to use `llama3` model (configurable via environment variables)
- **API Methods**:
  - `ollama.list`: Retrieves available models
  - `ollama.generate`: Text generation for agent reasoning
  - `ollama.chat`: Conversational interface for agent interactions

### Debugging Status

The Ollama integration is currently being debugged after the migration to the new Docker/MCP architecture. Specific issues being addressed:

1. Network connectivity between agent containers and the Ollama service
2. Model loading and availability verification
3. Response formatting and parsing
4. Performance optimization for multi-agent interactions

## Agent Swarm Implementation

The AI Project Management system utilizes a swarm of specialized agents, each focused on specific aspects of project management:

- **Chat Coordinator**: Main interface for user interactions
- **Project Manager**: PMBOK/PMP certified agent for project planning
- **Research Specialist**: Gathers information and best practices
- **Business Analyst**: Analyzes requirements and creates specifications
- **Code Developer**: Implements solutions based on specifications
- **Code Reviewer**: Reviews and improves code quality
- **Report Drafter**: Creates documentation and reports
- **Report Reviewer**: Ensures documentation quality
- **Report Publisher**: Finalizes reports for delivery

These agents communicate via the MCP infrastructure, sharing context through the Memory MCP's knowledge graph.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Complete Ollama Integration Debugging**: Finalize the connectivity between agent swarm and Ollama
2. **Agent Memory Optimization**: Improve the efficiency of the knowledge graph implementation
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify end-to-end workflows with the new architecture

### Medium-Term Goals

1. **Jira Integration Enhancements**: Expand the capabilities of the Atlassian MCP
2. **Agent Specialization Refinement**: Further tune the prompts and roles of each agent
3. **Performance Profiling**: Identify and address bottlenecks in the system

## Technical Debt and Considerations

- The migration from the previous Docker setup has introduced some temporary inconsistencies that need to be resolved
- Environment variable management needs to be further centralized and secured
- Log rotation and maintenance procedures should be implemented for long-running deployments
- Backup and restore procedures for the agent memory need to be documented and tested

## Conclusion

The AI Project Management system has undergone significant architectural improvements, moving from a monolithic Docker approach to a modular MCP-based design. This change provides greater flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility, setting the foundation for more robust agent interactions and capabilities. While the Ollama integration is still being finalized, the overall system design is now more aligned with best practices for AI agent systems.

The current phase of development focuses on debugging and optimizing the new architecture, with particular attention to the agent swarm's interaction with Ollama for text generation and reasoning tasks.
