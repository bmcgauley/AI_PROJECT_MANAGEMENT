  - [x] Fix SQLite dependency issues with ChromaDB
  - [x] Fix LiteLLM provider configuration for Ollama integration
  - [x] Fix WebSocket JSON serialization error for CrewOutput objects
  - [x] Create Atlassian MCP server requirements file
  - [x] Refactor crew_main.py into modular files
  - [x] Implement Atlassian MCP server for Jira integration
  - [ ] Test Crew.ai implementation
  - [ ] Add unit tests for Crew.ai implementation
  - [ ] Validate thought streaming improvements
  - [ ] Document Crew.ai migration process

### Pending
- [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms for agent failures
- [ ] Implement better agent thought visualization in UI
- [ ] Set up monitoring for agent states
- [ ] Create deployment documentation for Crew.ai version
- [ ] Update existing tests to work with Crew.ai

### Completed
- [x] Initial project setup
- [x] LangChain implementation
- [x] Basic web interface
- [x] MCP server integration
- [x] Agent system architecture
- [x] Fix permission issue with crew_main.py
- [x] Configure system startup to use Crew.ai implementation
- [x] Implement ChromaDB SQLite version workaround using pysqlite3-binary
- [x] Fix Crew.ai configuration issue for verbose parameter
- [x] Enhance agent routing system for proper multi-agent coordination
- [x] Fix startup script to properly handle SQLite compatibility with ChromaDB

## Discovered During Work
- [ ] Need to improve agent thought streaming visualization
- [ ] Consider adding agent memory persistence
- [ ] Add better error handling for agent communication
- [ ] Create system health dashboard
- [x] Fix SQLite version compatibility issue with ChromaDB
- [x] Fix LiteLLM configuration to properly recognize Ollama model formats
- [ ] Add system startup validation for Crew.ai dependencies
- [ ] Add migration rollback procedure in case of issues
- [ ] Implement Atlassian/Jira project creation functionality
- [ ] Add proper credential management for Atlassian API tokens

## Future Tasks
1. Performance optimization
   - [ ] Profile agent communication
   - [ ] Optimize WebSocket updates
   - [ ] Improve response times

2. UI Improvements
   - [ ] Add better visualization for agent thoughts
   - [ ] Implement collapsible thought patterns
   - [ ] Add agent state indicators

3. Testing & Documentation
   - [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for Crew.ai implementation
   - [ ] Update API documentation
   - [ ] Create user guide for system operation
   - [ ] Document dependency management and workarounds

## Notes
- Current focus is on migrating to Crew.ai for better reliability
- Need to maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Consider adding monitoring and metrics collection
- Document all changes in project-log directory
- SQLite version compatibility issues require pysqlite3-binary and ChromaDB mocking
- Atlassian integration requires proper server implementation and credential management
