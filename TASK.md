# AI Project Management System - Task List

## Current Sprint (May 4, 2025)

### In Progress
- [x] Migration from LangChain to Crew.ai
  - [x] Create initial Crew.ai implementation (crew_main.py)
  - [x] Update requirements.txt with Crew.ai dependency
  - [x] Update start_system.sh to use crew_main.py
  - [x] Fix SQLite dependency issues with ChromaDB
  - [x] Fix LiteLLM provider configuration for Ollama integration
  - [x] Fix WebSocket JSON serialization error for CrewOutput objects
  - [x] Create Atlassian MCP server requirements file
  - [x] Refactor crew_main.py into modular files
  - [x] Implement Atlassian MCP server for Jira integration
  - [x] Test Crew.ai implementation
  - [x] Add unit tests for Jira integration via Atlassian MCP server
  - [x] Enhance agent routing system to fix default-to-Project-Manager issue
  - [x] Validate thought streaming improvements
  - [x] Remove monolithic implementation and use modular architecture
  - [x] Document Crew.ai migration process


- [ ] Fix the issue where VS Codes MCPs are on the same mcp network as the agent swarm causing user conflicts between the IDE and the final product (conflict). Specifically with file system and context7.

### Pending
- [x] Add error recovery mechanisms for agent failures
- [ ] Implement better agent thought visualization in UI
- [ ] Set up monitoring for agent states
- [ ] Create deployment documentation for Crew.ai version
- [ ] Update existing tests to work with Crew.ai

### Completed
- [x] Initial project setup
- [x] LangChain implementation
- [x] Basic web interface
- [x] MCP server integration
- [x] Agent system architecture
- [x] Fix permission issue with crew_main.py
- [x] Configure system startup to use Crew.ai implementation
- [x] Implement ChromaDB SQLite version workaround using pysqlite3-binary
- [x] Fix Crew.ai configuration issue for verbose parameter
- [x] Enhance agent routing system for proper multi-agent coordination
- [x] Fix startup script to properly handle SQLite compatibility with ChromaDB
- [x] Migrate from monolithic crew_main.py to modular src/main.py architecture

## Discovered During Work
- [ ] Need to improve agent thought streaming visualization
- [ ] Consider adding agent memory persistence
- [ ] Add better error handling for agent communication
- [ ] Create system health dashboard
- [x] Fix SQLite version compatibility issue with ChromaDB
- [x] Fix LiteLLM configuration to properly recognize Ollama model formats
- [ ] Add system startup validation for Crew.ai dependencies
- [ ] Add migration rollback procedure in case of issues
- [x] Implement Atlassian/Jira project creation functionality
- [x] Add proper credential management for Atlassian API tokens
- [x] Fix routing issue where simple greetings defaulted to Project Manager agent

## Future Tasks
1. Performance optimization
   - [ ] Profile agent communication
   - [ ] Optimize WebSocket updates
   - [ ] Improve response times

2. UI Improvements
   - [ ] Add better visualization for agent thoughts
   - [ ] Implement collapsible thought patterns
   - [ ] Add agent state indicators

3. Testing & Documentation
   - [x] Create comprehensive test suite for Jira integration
   - [ ] Update API documentation
   - [ ] Create user guide for system operation
   - [ ] Document dependency management and workarounds

## Notes
- Current focus is on migrating to Crew.ai for better reliability
- Need to maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Consider adding monitoring and metrics collection
- Document all changes in project-log directory
- SQLite version compatibility issues require pysqlite3-binary and ChromaDB mocking
- Atlassian integration requires proper server implementation and credential management

## Progress Tracking
